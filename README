Timsort (powersort) for ATS2/Postiats
-------------------------------------

Currently there is just an array sort that supports linear types. The
insertion sort uses binary search, and the merge supports galloping.

I may add a sort for list_vt. This would have more conventional
insertion sort and merge.
