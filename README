Timsort (powersort) for ATS2/Postiats and C
-------------------------------------------

Implementations of natural mergesort employing the ‘powerset’
strategy. ‘Powersort’ is the strategy employed in later versions of
Timsort—that is, in the sort implementation of the C-Python
interpreter.

Included:

  * An array sort, for ATS2, that supports linear types. The insertion
    sort uses binary search, and the merge uses galloping if this
    seems to help.

  * Sort functions for C, which are the foregoing array sort
    specialized for particular C types. Probably the most important of
    these types are void pointers and size_t, which can be used for
    general sorting. Also supported are numerous integer and floating
    point types.

    The interfaces are ‘true’ C functions: there is no special runtime
    code needed. Both ‘envless’ and ‘reentrant’ (‘env-full’)
    interfaces are available.


And I may add a sort for list_vt. This would have more conventional
insertion sort and merge.

It is possible to make it so you do not need ATS2 to compile the
program, as long as someone has already generated the C code from the
ATS2. However, I have not yet decided whether to implement this
ability. The C generated by patsopt is impenetrable; therefore, if you
had to modify the programs, you would almost certainly need
ATS2. Fortunately ATS2 is not very difficult to install; it requires
only standard C and optionally the GNU Multiple Precision Library.
